All other PSP models, except for the PSP Street (E1000), can also run custom firmware, but they may require different methods and steps depending on their hardware and software versions. To find out the best way to hack your PSP, you can use our wizard tool or visit the Hackinformer website and enter your PSP model and firmware version.
  
Custom firmware is a modified version of the official firmware that runs on your PSP. It gives you access to features and functions that are not available on the original firmware, such as playing games from other regions, emulating retro consoles, backing up your games to a memory card, and more. Custom firmware is usually installed by using an exploit or a hack that allows you to run unsigned code on your PSP.

There are two main types of custom firmware: permanent and temporary. Permanent custom firmware is installed on your PSP's internal memory and stays there even after you turn off your device. Temporary custom firmware is loaded from a memory card and needs to be activated every time you reboot your PSP. The type of custom firmware you can use depends on your PSP model and firmware version. Some models can only use temporary custom firmware, while others can choose between permanent and temporary.
  
Before you install custom firmware on your PSP, you need to know your PSP model and firmware version. You can find this information by going to Settings > System Settings > System Information on your PSP. You also need to have a compatible memory card with enough space to store the custom firmware files. Once you have these requirements, you can use our wizard or the Hackinformer site to guide you through the process of hacking your PSP.
